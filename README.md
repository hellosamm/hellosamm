- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sam. I am a self taught software engineer transitioning from a successful career in education. I am energized by starting new projects and love to share what I know with others. My background in teaching taught me how to navigate difficult conversations, leverage feedback for improvement and adapt to *unexpected* challenges.
  
- As an artist and designer I am constantly learning new things. Lately I've been exploring creativity through cooking, surfing and sewing.
