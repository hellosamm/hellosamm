- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sam. I am a former public educator pursuing a career in tech. Teaching taught me SO many valuable lessons; how to lead, develop curriculum and work under pressure while staying flexible. As an artist and designer I am inspired by getting my hands dirty and am constantly pushing myself to learn new things.

- lately I've been baking lots of bread- sourdough, bagels, naan, english muffins.. you name it I've probably tried to make it!
