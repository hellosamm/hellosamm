- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sam. I am a self taught software engineer transitioning from a successful career in education. I am energized by starting new projects and love to share what I know with others. My background in teaching taught me how to navigate difficult conversations, leverage feedback for improvement and adapt to *unexpected* challenges.

- Iâ€™ve built full-stack apps with Rails and React, deployed on Render, integrated Amazon S3 for user-uploaded images and tested APIs with Postman. My unique background allows me to approach challenges creatively. I am scrappy, eager to learn, and ready to roll up my sleeves and get to work. 
  
- As an artist and designer I am constantly learning new things. Lately I've been exploring creativity through cooking, surfing and sewing.
