- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sam. I am a former public educator pursuing a career in tech. Teaching taught me SO many valuable lessons; how to lead, develop curriculum and work under pressure while staying flexible
  
- As an artist and designer I am constantly learning new things and making, what I call, *artsy messes*.

- lately I've been exploring creativity through cooking, surfing and sewing.
